# Douglasie Server

Douglasie Server builds the Parquet Reader backend for the [Douglasie VSCode Plugin](https://github.com/coffeeandcloud/douglasie). It provides an easy to use interface for loading (and in the future also querying) Parquet files with support for larger files. The server provides an gRPC based endpoint that can not only be accessed from VSCode but offers an CLI-based tool as well (can be found in `v1/cli`).
